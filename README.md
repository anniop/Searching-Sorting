## 🤔 Why Do We Need Searching and Sorting?

Imagine you're in a library.

- 📚 **Searching** helps you **find a specific book** in a shelf.
- 🧹 **Sorting** helps organize all books **alphabetically or by genre**, making searching and access much faster.

### 🔎 Searching
- Goal: **Find a specific value** in a list of elements.
- Examples:
  - Is a student roll number present?
  - Did someone already register for the event?

### 🔃 Sorting
- Goal: **Arrange the elements** in a specific order.
- Examples:
  - Sort students by marks.
  - Sort files by last edited time.

## 🧠 Real-Life Analogies

- 📇 Searching: Looking through contacts on your phone for "Rohan".
- 🗂 Sorting: Organizing all the files in a folder from A-Z or by date.

## 🔎 Searching Algorithms

| Sl No. | Algorithm         | Description                                      |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1.     | Linear Search      | Go element-by-element until match is found      |
| 2.     | Binary Search      | Efficient search on **sorted arrays** using divide and conquer |
| 3.     | Ternary Search     | Divides array into 3 parts (less common)        |

We’ll cover both **iterative** and **recursive** forms where applicable.

## 🔃 Sorting Algorithms

| Sl No. | Algorithm         | Description                                      |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1.     | Bubble Sort        | Repeatedly swap adjacent elements if needed     |
| 2.     | Selection Sort     | Select the smallest/largest and place at correct position |
| 3.     | Insertion Sort     | Insert each element into its right place        |
| 4.     | Merge Sort         | Divide array, sort halves, merge them (stable, guaranteed n log n) |
| 5.     | Quick Sort         | Choose pivot, partition, sort recursively (fast but not stable) |
| 6.     | Count Sort         | Use frequency array (good for known small ranges) |
| 7.     | Radix Sort         | Non-comparative, digit-based sorting            |
| 8.     | Heap Sort          | Based on max-heap/min-heap data structure       |

## 🧪 Time Complexity Comparison

### 🔎 Searching

| Algorithm      | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case | Sorted Array Required? |
|----------------|-----------|---------------|------------|-------------------------|
| Linear Search  | O(1)      | O(n)          | O(n)       | ❌ No                   |
| Binary Search  | O(1)      | O(log n)      | O(log n)   | ✅ Yes                  |
| Ternary Search | O(1)      | O(log n)      | O(log n)   | ✅ Yes                  |

### 🔃 Sorting

| Algorithm      | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case | Space | Stable |
|----------------|-----------|---------------|------------|--------|--------|
| Bubble Sort    | O(n)      | O(n²)         | O(n²)      | O(1)   | ✅     |
| Selection Sort | O(n²)     | O(n²)         | O(n²)      | O(1)   | ❌     |
| Insertion Sort | O(n)      | O(n²)         | O(n²)      | O(1)   | ✅     |
| Merge Sort     | O(n log n)| O(n log n)    | O(n log n) | O(n)   | ✅     |
| Quick Sort     | O(n log n)| O(n log n)    | O(n²)      | O(log n) | ❌   |
| Count Sort     | O(n+k)    | O(n+k)        | O(n+k)     | O(n+k) | ✅     |
| Heap Sort      | O(n log n)| O(n log n)    | O(n log n) | O(1)   | ❌     |

🧾 Note: `k` = range of input values in Count Sort

## 📌 When Should You Use What?

| Scenario                                | Best Choice        | Why                           |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Small/unsorted array, quick solution    | Linear Search       | Simple and no sorting needed |
| Fast search on sorted data              | Binary Search       | O(log n) time is efficient   |
| Sorting small array by hand             | Insertion Sort      | Easy to write and debug      |
| Guaranteed fast sorting (large input)   | Merge Sort          | Stable, predictable          |
| Fastest in practice (array)             | Quick Sort          | In-place and very fast       |
| You know value range beforehand         | Count Sort          | O(n) time possible           |
| Need priority structure                 | Heap Sort           | Supports min/max operations  |
